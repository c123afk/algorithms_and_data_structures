    "I worked on question 1; the objective was to search for and return the duplicate value closest to the root, otherwise return -1 if no duplicates exist. My process was to traverse all the values at the current level before moving onto a deeper level (breadth first search), keeping track of the traversed nodes in a set and the current level. The current node is compared to the set of traversed nodes to see if itâ€™s a duplicate value. The traversal stops when a duplicate is found or until the tree is completed. \n",

Since the objective doesnâ€™t need to account for duplicates, a set would have reduced time complexity compared to a list."
